      The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want a pair of

      Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic
    </p>
    <p class="blog-article__text">
      Gaming headphones are regular headphones that are used traditionally for
      music enjoyment. However, they possess qualities that are awesome for
      gaming needs too. Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail
      retrieval, accurate sound stage and immersive sound experience make them
      feasible to double up as a pair of gaming headphones.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-article__text">
      However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do they
      have any mic attachment slots. You will need to get an external mic like
      the Blue Yeti X for communication support.

      A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, famous
      for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with
      Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming his
      games.
